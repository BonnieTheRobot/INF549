## Instructions for using these notebooks ##

This fold contains four notebooks, one for social network analysis and three for image processing. 

In the social network analysis notebook, functions are implemented by a Python library for studying graphs and networks called [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io). You're welcome to explore it by yourself. We provided two social network dataset named "Revolution.txt" and "HighSchoolClubs.txt" for your reference. You can also input your own dataset as long as you follows the same format of the given datasets.

There are three image processing notebooks implemented by a Python library called [scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org). If you installed Jupyter Notebook by Annaconda, Scikit-image should have been in your computer already. If you don't have it, please refer to the [installation instructions](http://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/install.html). The three notebooks include functions like [Canny edge detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector), [watershed segmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watershed_(image_processing)) and smoothing by [Gaussian filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur).
