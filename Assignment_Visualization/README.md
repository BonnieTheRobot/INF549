## Instructions for using these notebooks ##

This fold contains three notebooks, i.e. parallel coordinates, a scatter plot and a choropleth map to help you visualize data. You should not only visualize the given datasets or your own datasets but also analyze and conclude what you learn from the visualization. If a dataset is well illustrated by a visualization notebook, try to explain why it works. If a notebook does not give you any useful information by visualizing a dataset, try to give some reasons about why it is not a good fit and suggest what kind of visualization might perform better.

All the visualization notebooks are implemeneted by [Plotly](https://plot.ly), a popular graphing library for Python.
