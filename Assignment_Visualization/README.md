## Instructions for using these notebooks ##

This fold contains three notebooks, i.e. parallel coordinates, a scatter plot and a choropleth map to help you visualize data. You should not only visualize the given datasets or your own datasets but also analyze and conclude what you learn from the visualization. If a dataset is well illustrated by a visualization notebook, try to explain why it works. If a notebook does not give you any useful information by visualizing a dataset, try to give some reasons about why it is not a good fit and suggest what kind of visualization might perform better.

All the visualization notebooks are implemented by [Plotly](https://plot.ly), a popular graphing library for Python. If you don't have Plotly installed on your machine, [click here](https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/) for installation instructions.

The first notebook is for [parallel coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_coordinates). Parallel coordinates are a common way of visualizing high-dimensional geometry and analyzing multivariate data. We provide three datasets for you to test this notebook. All the dataset includes multivariate data and choosing how many and which specific attributes is at your discretion.
* ["Edu-Data.csv"](https://www.kaggle.com/aljarah/xAPI-Edu-Data) is an educational dataset from Kaggle, a well-known platform for data science enthusiasts.
* ["iris.csv"](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris) is a classic classfication dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
* ["Auto.csv"](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/data.html) is an automobile dataset from a statistical learning textbook called An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R.

The second notebook is for a [scatterplot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scatter_plot). A scatterplot is a type of plot using Cartesian coordinates to display values for typically two variables for a set of data. To run the notebook, you can use the three datasets mentioned above or your own datasets. You should decide the attributes among which you want to explore the relationships.

The third notebook is for a [choropleth map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map). A choropleth map is a thematic map in which areas are shaded or patterned in proportion to the measurement of the statistical variable being displayed on the map, such as population density or per capita income. To run the notebook, you can use any dataset described by US states, like the ["States ranked by per capita income.csv"](https://github.com/RupertMa/INF549/tree/master/Assignment_Visualization) provided in this repository. Choosing what variables as the attribute and breakdown is at your discretion.
