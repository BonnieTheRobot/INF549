## Instructions for using this notebook ##

This fold contains two machine learning algorithms, decision tree and Naive Bayes.

For decision tree, the algorithm used here is called CART (classification and regression tree), which can take both discrete and continuous values as the input. For illustration purpose, we provided two datasets, iris.data and lenses.txt. All the variables in iris.data are continuous values and all the variables in lenses.txt are discrete values. When discrete string values are inputted, the notebook will print the codebook for each continuous variable.
