## Instructions for using this notebook ##

This fold contains two machine learning algorthims, decision tree and naive bayes.

For decision tree, we used a decision tree algorithm called CART (classification and regression tree), which can take both discrete and continuous values as the input. For illustration purpose, we provided two datasets, iris.data and lenses.txt. All variables in iris.data are continuous values and all variables in lenses.txt are discrete values. When discrete values are inputted, the notebook will print the code book for each continuous variable.
