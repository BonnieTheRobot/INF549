## How to run Jupyter Notebook? ##
You can run the notebook document step-by-step (one cell a time) by pressing shift + enter or by clicking either the “Play” (the black triangle) button the toolbar, or Cell | Run in the menu bar.      
You can run the whole notebook in a single step by clicking on the menu Cell -> Run All.       
To restart the kernel (i.e. the computational engine), click on the menu Kernel -> Restart. This can be useful to start over a computation from scratch (e.g. variables are deleted, open files are closed, etc...).
